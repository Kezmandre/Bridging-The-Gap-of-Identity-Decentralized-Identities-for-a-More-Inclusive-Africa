      <article>
        In the digital age, the question of identity has taken on new
        dimensions. As individuals navigate the virtual world, their identities
        serve as both passports and vulnerabilities. The number of
        interconnected devices in these deployments, their placement in the
        environment, often widely accessible, their typically unattended
        operation, and the sheer volume of data produced makes them susceptible
        to malicious attacks and unauthorized access [1], emphasizing the need
        for robust protection. Specifically, 112.24 million
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">
          Internet of Things (IOT)
        </a>
        attacks were encountered in [2]. Decentralized identity (dID) systems,
        which encompass a broader set of principles for managing digital
        identities in a decentralized manner, offer a promising approach to
        addressing these concerns. By empowering individuals with greater
        control over their personal data and identity information, dID systems
        reduce reliance on centralized identity providers.

        In many parts of the world, having an identity is something we take for
        granted. It&apos;s just a basic part of our everyday lives, something we
        use to access services, travel, and participate in society. But in
        Africa, millions of people are still living without any form of
        identification. This lack of identity leaves them unable to access
        essential services, education, healthcare, and even the right to vote.
      </article>

      <article>
        According to the World Bank, an estimated one billion people around the
        world are living without any form of identification. In Sub-Saharan
        Africa alone, that number is believed to be around 500 million. This
        lack of identity not only affects individuals, but it also has a
        significant impact on the economic development of the continent as a
        whole. <br />
        This article aim to demystify decentralized identities and why they are
        important in Africa.

      <h2>Evolution of Identities</h2>
      <article>
        Since the dawn of civilization, proving who we are has been fundamental.
        From cave paintings to clay tablets, the way we identify ourselves has
        evolved along side society. Today, in the digital age, our identities
        are once again undergoing a transformation. To understand decentralized
        identities, it is pertinent to review other models of identities. The
        models for online identity have advanced through four broad stages since
        the advent of the Internet: centralized identity, federated identity,
        user-centric identity, and decentralized identity.
      </article>
      <h2>
        Centralized Identity (Administrative Control by a single Authority)
      </h2>
      <article>
        In real world scenarios, the identification of individual was
        traditionally facilitated by centralized identities, usually government
        bodies which were responsible for the creation, modification,
        verification, and revocation of such identities. The continuity of the
        pattern of centralized identity management persisted with the advent of
        the Internet, compelling users to manage multiple identities to access
        different websites or online services. Organizations such as Internet
        Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) [3], Internet Corporation for Assigned
        Names and Numbers (ICANN) [4], and certificate authorities (CAs) [5]
        were established to validate IP addresses, mediate domain names, and
        assist e-commerce sites in verifying their identity. <br />
        <br />
        Unfortunately, granting control of digital identity to centralized
        authorities of the online world suffers from the same problems caused by
        the state authorities of the physical world, users are locked in to a
        single authority who can deny their identity or even confirm a false
        identity. Centralization innately gives power to the centralized
        entities, not to the users. As the Internet grew, as power accumulated
        across hierarchies, a further problem was revealed, identities were
        increasingly balkanized. They multiplied as web sites did, forcing users
        to juggle dozens of identities on dozens of different sites while having
        control over none of them.
      </article>
      <h2>
        Federated Identity (administrative Control by multiple, federated
        authorities)
      </h2>
      <article>
        The initial breakthrough in digital identity was federated identity it
        is a system of mutual trust established among multiple organizations or
        online entities, allowing users to use a single digital identity across
        various websites or services. Allows authorized users to access multiple
        applications and domains with a single set of credentials like when
        people can use their Google or Facebook to sign into websites or apps.
        <br />
        <br />
        Microsoft&apos;s Passport (1999) initiative was one of the first. It
        imagined federated identity, which allowed users to utilize the same
        identity on multiple sites. However, it put Microsoft at the center of
        the federation, which made it almost as centralized as traditional
        authorities. <br />
        <br />
        In response Sun Microsoft organized the Liberty Alliance (2001). They
        resisted the idea of centralized authority, instead creating a “true”
        federation, but the result was instead an oligarchy:, the power of
        centralized authority was now divided among several powerful entities.
        The failure of federated identity can be pinpointed to the fact that
        even though users have gained some level of control over their digital
        identity, this control is still subject to the authority of the
        federated entity and could potentially be revoked at any time.
        Federation improved on the problem of balkanization, users could wander
        from site to site under the system. However, each individual site
        remained an authority.
      </article>
      <h2>
        User-Centric Identity (individual or administrative control across
        multiple authorities without requiring a federation)
      </h2>
      <article>
        The concept of user-centric identity marked a significant step towards
        recognizing the necessity of decentralized identities . User-centric
        methodologies prioritized user consent and interoperability. Projects
        linked to this form of digital identity envisioned that, eventually,
        each person would be able to manage their digital identity. According to
        Motykowski et al. [6], during the Internet Identity Workshop in 2005,
        the concept of User-Centric Identity was introduced with the objective
        of developing an identification method that would be continuous and not
        subject to reassignment to a different user, unlike email addresses or
        phone numbers. The concept of User-Centric Identity marked a significant
        step toward recognizing. <br />
        <br />
        It is worth noting that the concept of User-Centric Identity was
        initially proposed by the Augmented Social Network (ASN), circa 2000.
        This is documented in the white paper by Jordon et al. [7]. Although the
        exact term is not mentioned, they proposed incorporating a persistent,
        online identity as an integral part of the Internet&apos;s architecture.
        <br />
        <br />
        The work of the IIW has supported many new methods for creating digital
        identity, including OpenID (2005), OpenID 2.0 (2006), OpenID Connect
        (2014), OAuth (2010), and FIDO (2013). As implemented, user-centric
        methodologies tend to focus on two elements: user consent and
        interoperability. By adopting them, a user can decide to share an
        identity from one service to another and thus debalkanize his digital
        self. <br />
        <br />
        OpenID offers an example. A user can theoretically register his own
        OpenID, which he can then use autonomously. However, this takes some
        technical know-how, so the casual Internet user is more likely to use an
        OpenID from one public web site as a login for another. If the user
        selects a site that is long-lived and trustworthy, he can gain many of
        the advantages of a self-sovereign identity ,but it could be taken away
        at any time by the registering entity. It&apos;s central authorities all
        over again. Worse, it&apos;s like state-controlled authentication of
        identity, except with a self-elected “rogue” state. In other words,
        being user-centric isn&apos;t enough.

      <h2>
        Decentralized Identity (individual control across any number of
        authorities)
      </h2>
      <article>
        Image if; you could onboard every new customer with 1 click, each of
        your customers had a secure, direct connection to you, you could
        instantly verify that every customer is genuine, your customers never

        payments, you could send every customer verifiable digital receipts.
        Look no further a seismic change is underway. The way we think about and
        use digital identity is transforming, touching every aspect of digital
        life. Enter “Decentralized Identity”. <br />
        <br />
        Decentralized identification is a technology that is handled with the
        help of all participants. It has a different architecture compared to
        centralized and federated identification services. There is no single
        organization inside to manage identification [8]. Usually, a
        decentralized identifier works in a peer-to-peer network, such as
        Distributed Ledger Technology and Distributed Hash Table. Decentralized
        identification systems are formed by many nodes that can be users,
        organizations, issuers, and validators. Self-sovereign identity systems
        represent a kind of this system. They operate to manage digital
        identities where the users themselves manage attributes. Unlike
        traditional identity systems, DIDs are based on privacy, security, and
        efficiency principles. They aim to provide a decentralized and
        interoperable identity ecosystem that can be used across various
        industries and services. <br />
        <br />
        On the other hand, decentralized approaches not relying on any
        centralized Identity provider. In contrast with traditional,
        centralized, and federated approaches that are account-based or digital
        certificate-based and require entities, e.g., users to trust and rely on
        identity providers, the latter is based on peer-to-peer relationships
        between interacting parties. Hence, the ecosystem consists of various
        entities that enact roles formerly performed by central authority [8].
        It enhances decentralization, transparency, and user control [9] in
        transactions involving identity information. And usually relies on some
        form of decentralized ledger technology (DLT), blockchain, distributed
        file system, or another de centralized system, such as Hash graphs and
        Tangle [10]. <br />
        <br />
        Open-source Hyperledger projects can also be used, as Hyperledger Indy
        was specifically built for the implementation of decentralized identity.
        Thus can be used standalone or with other blockchains [11][12]. The use
        of blockchain is the most popular, however not mandatory for the
        implementation of decentralized identity as it can also be achieved with
        mentioned alternatives [13]. Nevertheless, blockchain may facilitate the
        implementation of decentralized identity, and it coincides with some
        desirable properties of Self Sovereign Identity [14]. <br />
        <br />
        The transition from centralized to decentralized identities signifies a
        significant advancement in digital identity management, improving user
        privacy, security, and empowerment. While centralized systems rely on
        conventional password-based authentication, decentralized systems can
        employ sophisticated methods like
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">
          Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)</a
        >, allowing users to authenticate their identity without disclosing
        extra information, thereby enhancing privacy.

      <h2>Elements of Decentralized Identities</h2>
      <article>
        Two technical concepts that are an essential part of most
        blockchain-based identity approaches are Decentralized Identifiers
        (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). Both are currently being
        developed by the World Wide Web Consortia (W3C), which also illustrates
        the ongoing standardization efforts around Decentralized identity
        management. [15, 16].
      </article>
      <h3>Decentralized Identifiers (DID)</h3>
      <article>
        The DID is a new type of globally unique digital identifier associated
        with a subject and a DID document [17]. The subject, which is normally
        called “DID subject,” refers to the entity that this DID identifies. The
        DID subject could be anything, such as people, organization, thing or
        digital information, so it satisfies the need for industrial Internet
        and Internet of Things IoT requirements. The DID document is a set of
        data describing the DID subject, including the DIDs, the public keys,
        and the services endpoints relevant to the subject. The DID points to
        the DID document, and the DID document contains the information of the
        DID subject, [17]. <br />
        <br />
        Unlike the other digital identity systems, which have distinct hierarchy
        frameworks, the DID builds a direct relationship between subjects and
        blockchains. Initially, anyone or anything with the proper software can
        generate a DID, and begin using it immediately without requiring the
        authorization or involvement of any centralized registration authority.
        This is the same process used to create public addresses on the Bitcoin
        or Ethereum or other popular blockchains. Meanwhile, the DID document
        records the way how this DID is created and its only controller. <br />
        <br />
        Finally, both DID and DID document are stored in the blockchain, which
        makes the DID self-controlled and decentralized. Basically, the DID is a
        string, and it is randomly generated according to encryption algorithm
        and software, not dependent on the issuance and authorization of
        authority. The DID is pretty much similar to a bitcoin address, but it
        has more properties as follows [19];
        <p>
          (i) <span>Permanent</span> . Once the DID is created, it can never be
          changed, since it is recorded in the blockchain or other distributed
          ledgers
        </p>
        <p>
          (ii) <span>Resolvable</span> . Since the DID is pairwise with a DID
          document, which contains the metadata of the subject, everyone could
          look it up to discover the metadata of the DID.
        </p>
        <p>
          (iii)<span>Verifable.</span> A DID is associated with one public/
          private key pair, the controller of the private key can prove that
          they are the only owner of the DID. On the contrary, anyone could
          verify this DID to ensure it belongs to the real controller.
        </p>
        <p>
          (iv) <span>Decentralized</span>. Te cryptography mechanism eliminates
          the need for centralized registration authorities, the kind of system
          needed for almost every other global identifier systems we use. DID
          and DID document could be store in blockchain, which play the role as
          the trust anchor, and it exactly realizes the decentralized feature of
          this new type identifier
        </p>
      </article>
      <h3>Verifiable Credentials (VC)</h3>
      <article>
        The verifiable credentials (VC) are one of the most important elements
        of SSI, and it is the manifestation of DID. The W3C verifiable
        credential data model v1.1 illustrates that “Credentials are a part of
        our daily lives; driver&apos;s licenses are used to assert that we are
        capable of operating a motor vehicle, university degrees can be used to
        assert our level of education, and government issued passports enable us
        to travel between countries” [19], while verifiable credentials are
        digital credentials that are closely related to DID and provide
        authentication for a decentralized identity. Verifiable Credentials
        contain 3 main components [19, 20]:
        <p>
          (i) <span>Metadata:</span>Issued with the issuer&apos;s cryptographic
          signature. “describe attributes of the credential, such as the issuer,
          the expiration date and time, a representative image, a public key to
          use for verification purposes, the revocation method, and so on” [19].
        </p>

        <p>
          (ii) <span>Claims:</span> A declaration that is made on a topic. For
          instance, the statement that “Alice&apos;s date of birth is January 1,
          1990.”
        </p>

        <p>
          (iii) <span> Proofs:</span> A proof is data about yourself that
          enables other people to verify the source of the data, check that the
          data belongs to you, that the data has not been tampered with, and
          finally, that the data has not been revoked by the issuer. A proof is
          also known as an identity document or an identity credential
        </p>

        Fundamentally, instead of identities being composed of accounts or
        identifiers that are “borrowed” from providers, DID gives the controller
        the right to possess digital identities. As DIDs are more broadly
        adopted across the web, they give rise to a more resilient Internet,
        where digital identity is not borrowed from a provider, the way domain
        names and social media accounts are, but rather controlled by a
        controller and thus the basis of a new kind of verifiable digital trust.
        This makes the Internet not only a more reliable tool but a more robust
        platform for creating richer digital experiences [21]. Nevertheless, DID
        has been a hot topic in worldwide, just like the concept of blockchain,
        and there are remarkable implementations, pilots in different industrial
        areas, but whether it will bring revolutions both in social and economic
        remain to be seen.

      <h2>Decentralized identity for a more Inclusive Africa</h2>
      <article>
        In Africa, a staggering number of individuals remain without legal
        identification. According to World Bank data, this number reaches nearly
        half the continent&apos;s population, translating to around 500 million
        people. This lack of legal identification becomes a severe hurdle when
        these individuals attempt to access crucial services such as education,
        healthcare, banking, and even participation in electoral processes.
        <br />
        <br />
        Children turned away from schools without proper registration. Families
        evicted from generations-old lands with no titles. Aspiring
        entrepreneurs blocked from formal loans lacking verified identities.
        Even innocent prisoners languishing in jail unable to prove citizenship
        status after arrests. <br />
        <br />
        This predicament presents a significant impact on the region&apos;s
        economy. According to a study by the McKinsey Global Institute,
        Africa&apos;s economic value could surge by $5.7 trillion by the year
        2025 if it fully digitized financial services. However, such a digital
        transformation heavily depends on having a reliable and verifiable
        digital identity system in place. <br />
        <br />
        Thus, as connectivity penetrates all corners of the continent via mobile
        devices, decentralized digital identities present a monumental
        opportunity to credential the marginalized using embedded cryptography,
        public-key infrastructure, and self-sovereign identity principles. Those
        lacking state-sanctioned identity documents can claim verifiable
        personal data ownership restored. The exciting potentials for inclusion
        abound! Blockchain-enabled digital IDs operate independent of
        centralized authorities like governments, banks or aid agencies. Rather
        identity credentials get stored on distributed ledgers secured by
        encryption. This allows marginalized people to correctly own and control
        sensitive personal records--birth data, fingerprints, land deeds etc.
        While selective sharing access keys to such documentation only when
        required for receiving services. Power dynamics flip toward the people.

      <h2>Challenges of Establishing Digital Identity In Africa</h2>
      <article>
        Establishing reliable digital identity systems in Africa is challenging
        due to various factors. Limited infrastructure, illiteracy, and cultural
        barriers contribute to the difficulties in capturing and verifying
        identity information. Additionally, the lack of interoperability among
        different identity systems creates barriers to seamless identity
        verification across sectors and regions. <br />
        <br />
        One of the major challenges in establishing digital identity in Africa
        is the limited infrastructure. Many rural areas lack access to reliable
        internet connectivity and electricity, making it difficult to implement
        digital identity systems. Without the necessary infrastructure,
        individuals in these areas face significant barriers in accessing and
        benefiting from digital services. Illiteracy also poses a significant
        challenge in establishing digital identity. In some regions of Africa,
        the literacy rate is low, making it challenging for individuals to
        understand and navigate digital identity systems. This lack of literacy
        can hinder the adoption and usage of digital identity, limiting its
        potential impact on financial inclusion and socio-economic development.
        <br />
        <br />
        Cultural barriers further complicate the establishment of digital
        identity systems in Africa. Different cultural norms and practices may
        affect individuals&apos; willingness to share their personal information
        for identity verification purposes. Building trust and addressing
        privacy concerns are crucial in overcoming these cultural barriers and
        ensuring the successful implementation of digital identity systems.
        <br />
        <br />
        Despite these challenges, efforts are being made to address the current
        digital identity landscape in Africa. Governments, international
        organizations, and private sector entities are collaborating to develop
        innovative solutions that can overcome the infrastructure, literacy, and
        cultural barriers. By promoting digital literacy, investing in
        infrastructure development, and fostering cross-sector collaboration,
        Africa can unlock the full potential of digital identity and drive
        inclusive socio-economic growth.

        Decentralized Identities Initiative By Some Selected African Countries
      </h2>

      <article>
        Governments in Africa play vital roles in spearheading the expansion of
        digital ID adoption across the continent with the support from
        international initiatives such as World Bank&apos;s Identification for
        Development Initiative (ID4D). They take charge of extensive ID
        registration, ensuring that citizens can readily access official digital
        identities. While we've seen notable progress in this regard, there's
        still work to be done, especially when it comes to establishing a
        comprehensive legal and institutional framework for digital ID,
        including robust data protection measures.

          (1)preparation, (2)database building, (3)data updates, and
          (4)monetization. The RAVIP focused on phases (1)-(3), [23] . By the
          end of 2019, around 350,000 biometric ID cards were procured for
          distribution to underserved areas [24]. In 2020, Benin joined the
          World Bank's West Africa Unique Identification for Regional
          Integration and Inclusion (WURI) program4 , which aims to connect
          civil registration with human development and financial services,
          ultimately achieving Phase (4) of the eID system [25] . <br />
          In March 2020, they introduced a standard platform for over 300
          e-services that uses citizens' personal identification numbers for
          authentication [26] . At the same time, in 2019, the Smart Africa
          Digital Identity initiative began as part of the broader Smart Africa
          Initiative launched in 2013 to provide digital IDs to previously
          excluded people across Africa and create a single digital market [27].
          The initiative introduced a continental concept called Smart Africa
          Trust Alliance (SATA) for digital identity [27] . Benin, along with
          Rwanda and Tunisia, was selected in mid-2020 to host a pilot for the
          SATA digital ID project 1 . The project includes applications like
          cross-border mobile money, remittances, handicraft sales, and health
          insurance and/or test certificates for travellers [26] .
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Kenya:</span>In early 2019, Kenya began registering people for
          the National Integrated Identity Management System (NIIMS) or Huduma
          Namba. The project's goal was to create a single digital ID for easier
          access to public services [28]. As of May 2019, nearly 31 million
          Kenyans had already had their fingerprints scanned for this new
          biometric system [29]. In May 2019, the World Bank approved $750
          million to support Kenya's inclusive growth reforms, including the
          digital ID strategy, with the goal of improving government service
          delivery [30] . However, challenges such as travel distances, poor
          network coverage, and legal concerns emerged. To address data
          protection issues, the Data Protection Act was passed in late 2019
          [30]. In January 2020, the High Court ruled in favor of NIIMS but
          called for a regulatory framework for data collection [30] . <br />
          In August 2023, Kenya partnered with the United Nations Development
          Program (UNDP) to create an advanced digital identity system with
          iris, facial, and fingerprint biometrics, designed to improve access
          to online services, comply with international travel standards, and
          drive development [31] . This system comprises four parts: Maisha
          Namba (a unique personal number), Maisha Card (a third-gen ID),
          Digital ID (for online authentication), and the National Master
          Population Register (combining existing data) [32] . While planning to
          unveil it in early October, the Principal Secretary for Immigration
          and Citizen Services, Julius Bitok, announced that unforeseen issues
          led to a postponement in October 2023 [33] . Public engagement and
          stakeholder discussions continue, building on lessons from the Huduma
          Namba project [33] .
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Nigeria:</span>In 2007, Nigeria established the National
          Identity Management Commission (NIMC) to manage the National Identity
          Database, issue Unique National Identification Numbers (NINs), and
          General Multi-Purpose Cards (GMPCs) for citizens and legal residents
          [34] . The goal was to create a unified national identification system
          for government purposes. NIMC faced challenges, including a scandal
          with MasterCard in 2014, leading to legal actions in 2019 [35]. By
          2017, 10 years after NIMC's creation, only 20 million Nigerians (about
          10% of the population) were in the digital identity database [36]. In
          2019, the Commission claimed that it needed 10,000 registration
          centers but only had 1,000 [36]. The current NIMC effort, supported by
          the World Bank in 2020 through the ID4D initiative, aims to integrate
          various ID systems, promote gender inclusion, and strengthen the legal
          framework [37]. Despite existing data collected by multiple agencies,
          the new system involves mandatory registration at designated centers,
          assigning NIN [38] . <br />
          An eID card linked to the NIN is issued for various applications like
          payments, security, e-SIM, and more [38]. In 2020, NIMC released a
          mobile app for generating NIN, but it was insecure and raised privacy
          and security concerns []35. The lack of high-level technology impact
          assessment poses risks to citizens' privacy and rights [35]. By
          September 2022, Nigeria has registered nearly 90 million citizens for
          NIN, with plans to enrol 148 million by 2024, [39] . They faced
          capacity challenges but have been partnering with traditional
          institutions to reach rural areas [39].
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Ghana:</span>Until 2017, Ghana had six separate biometric
          databases, including national ID, health insurance, passports,
          driver's licenses, immigration, and voter rolls [40] . In 2017, the
          government started a project to centralize these databases by
          overhauling the Ghana Card. The new Ghana Card aims to enhance the
          credibility of private borrowers and reduce interest rates, with
          potential use as a primary registration document and a central data
          repository for personal credentials [41]. It may become mandatory for
          government and private services like passport applications, bank
          account openings, property registration, and education certificates
          [41]. In August 2023, all babies born in Ghana started receiving a
          Ghana Card number for life and a Birth Certificate Identification
          number [42]. The Ghana Card is increasingly being used as the single
          proof of ID among Ghanaians, although the problem of uncollected cards
          remains rife [43] . There has also been a move by the Ghana Election
          Commission to make it the sole ID for voter registration [44] .
