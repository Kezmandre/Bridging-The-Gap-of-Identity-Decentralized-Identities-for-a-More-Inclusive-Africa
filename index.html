        In the digital age, the question of identity has taken on new
        dimensions. As individuals navigate the virtual world, their identities
        serve as both passports and vulnerabilities. The number of
        interconnected devices in these deployments, their placement in the
        environment, often widely accessible, their typically unattended
        operation, and the sheer volume of data produced makes them susceptible
        to malicious attacks and unauthorized access [1], emphasizing the need
        for robust protection. Specifically, 112.24 million Internet of Things
        (IOT) attacks were encountered in [2]. Decentralized identity (dID)
        systems, which encompass a broader set of principles for managing
        digital identities in a decentralized manner, offer a promising approach
        to addressing these concerns. By empowering individuals with greater
        control over their personal data and identity information, dID systems
        reduce reliance on centralized identity providers.

        In many parts of the world, having an identity is something we take for
        granted. It&apos;s just a basic part of our everyday lives, something we
        use to access services, travel, and participate in society. But in
        Africa, millions of people are still living without any form of
        identification. This lack of identity leaves them unable to access
        essential services, education, healthcare, and even the right to vote.

        According to the World Bank, an estimated one billion people around the
        world are living without any form of identification. In Sub-Saharan
        Africa alone, that number is believed to be around 500 million. This
        lack of identity not only affects individuals, but it also has a
        significant impact on the economic development of the continent as a
        whole. <br> This article aim to demystify decentralized identities and why
        they are important in Africa.
